        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
            Music Tap is an expressive musical interface that utilizes the human body. It is a wearable piece of technology that allows any performer to create music on the go. This musical interface considers the overall experience of the performer, thus it can be used while sitting, standing or even lying down! The physical interface consists of a shirt and skirt that can be worn by a human user.
        </p>
        <h2>Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            Music Tap is an iteration of Music Slap. It consists of all the functionality presented in Music Slap and additional features. These additional features are discussed below. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple jewel buttons, each encoded to a musical note in the C4 octave (as default), are attached to an outfit consisting of a full-sleeve shirt and a skirt that can be worn by a human user. Tapping on a jewel button will produce a sound (from the computer using the serial port) of the corresponding musical note. As well, both sharps and flats are present in our musical interface!
            Music Tap can also switch between different octaves by toggling the two dark pink jewel buttons located on the lower back on the right side of the user:
            <ul>
                <li>If the lower jewel button is pressed, then all the musical notes in the interface decrease to an octave lower than the current octave setting</li>
                <li>If the upper jewel button is pressed, then all the musical notes in the interface increase to an octave higher than the current octave setting</li>
            </ul>
            It is intended that only the right hand is used to toggle these two jewel buttons, hence they are placed in a location easily accessible by this hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user input is taken via the Arduino code whereas the musical note sounds are produced from the computer attached via a python code file. The Arduino code sends messages to the connected port on the computer when it detects a user input and the python code file listens to messages sent to the port connected to the Arduino using the Serial module. Executing the python file after starting to run the Arduino code allows the two programs to communicate. This communication enables to produce the output sound of a musical note when a jewel button is touched. This sound is generated through the pygame.mixer module and emitted via the computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following discusses additions and improvements made to the Music Slap interface in order to create Music Tap. 
            <ul>
                <li>The cardboard puppet used to simulate a human being has been replaced by a human-like doll in order to accurately represent the interaction of the envisioned interface with a human user</li>
                <li>Each musical note has been allocated to a body part such as shoulders, thighs, hips, stomach, hand and knee for remembering the locations of musical notes easily</li>
                <li>The aluminium switches have been covered up with a shirt and skirt for a more aesthetic and finished look</li>
                <li>Each jewel button on the shirt and skirt is placed at the location of the aluminium foil switches underneath, hence indicating to the user where to press in order to produce the sound of the musical note</li>
                <li>The musical notes (jewel buttons) are placed in a manner on the interface to allow for a diverse set of choreographies with multiple different songs</li>
                <li>The pushbuttons that shifted the octaves have been replaced by two aluminium switches in order to include this feature on the user's body as well. These two switches are also indicated by jewel buttons on the shirt and are placed on the right lower back of the user in order to only allow the right hand to interact with these buttons</li>
                <li>The interface has been improved to consist of a complete musical scale</li>
                <li>The software has been improved to allow the user to play chords. By pressing on multiple shirt buttons at the same time, the musical notes corresponding to the pressed buttons are played in unison</li>
            </ul>
        </p> 
        
        <h2>Final Artifact</h2>
        <p>
            The images below showcase the final artifact:
        </p>
        <p>
            The natural music notes are represented with light pink jewel buttons on the shirt and skirt, whereas the sharp and flat music notes are presented by the dark pink jewel buttons on the shirt. The dark pink jewel buttons on the right lower back indicate the octave controls.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Note: Due to the limited amount of wiring available, a human-sized interface was not feasible to produce. Hence, a puppet was used to represent the human user in this image and in the demo videos showcased later. This puppet allows to get a feel of the interaction. </em>
