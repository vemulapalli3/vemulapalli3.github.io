        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
            There are times when we walk into a room and it seems boring and empty. With the same old posters on the walls and desk supplies, one might look to spice things up a bit (without much effort of course)! Hence, I present DigiEmoji.
        </p>
        <h2>Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            DigiEmoji is created with LEDs, a pushbutton and an Arduino Uno. Its main purpose is to serve as a piece of homedecor that can instantly enhance the atmosphere of a room (and even one's mind). With five built-in designs that can be controlled with a pushbutton, one has multiple options to from based on their mood or liking. Or if their liking changes, another design is ready to take on the spot light!
        </p>
        <p>
            The five designs are: Watermelon, Flower, Strawberry, Heart and Smiley Face. The user is able to iterate through these designs by pressing the pushbutton and the respective LEDs light up for the design selected. As well, once the last design is reached, the first design is displayed after clicking on the pushbutton therefore a cyclic iteration is implemented for the display of designs.
        </p>

            These images below showcase the five designs:
